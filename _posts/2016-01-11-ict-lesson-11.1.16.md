Today we looked at media literacy. He asked us what we thought what "media' was and after many wrong (or slightly right) answers he told us that they are channels of communications between groups. ITV is a good example of a medium. We then walked around the room asking people questions and giving people information to fill out a media bingo sheet. I believe the winner was 4 lines. We then looked at which question took the most asking to get a â€œyes" from. One of them was who had a twitter name. On that note he shortly explained how twitter is sort of dangerous because everyone can see what you say. We then looked at a basic media literacy concepts and the fact that some medias are not always true. We finally watched an ad for a KIA and looked at the main message, the underlying message and the probable target market. Our homework was to pick an ad at home and do those three things again.
