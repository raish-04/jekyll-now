We started the lesson by sorting out our internet connection because the majority of us did not have any wifi. After we sorted that out we split ourselves into 3s and looked at how social media made us feel connected and examples of that. Wen then wrote down personal connections with social media on a g.docs form. On the same form we wrote guidelines to social media. We got up to 8 in the end i think. We then watched a video (musical) about people addicted to twitter (as a joke) and how to use it properly.

Thanks again, raish-04
