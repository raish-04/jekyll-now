Today's lesson was undoubtedly a lesson of two halvesâ€¦..or three thirds. The first third was really successful. Given that I seriously struggled with the work we had last lesson I was surprised to see that I was getting through the exercises quite quickly. I got through two or three (intended to be) harder exerts in about 20 minutes (and a few easier ones as well). However, the bad trends from last week inevitably returned. That trend being endlessly searching for a minuscule mistake for about 10 minutes. That mistake was the misplacement of a number. So the second third was me struggling immensely with 1 or 2 exercises that in all honesty were not much harder than the ones I breezed through. The third third of the lesson what's almost like a recovery session. I steadily got through exercises but didn't blaze through the easily. It was almost like a compromise between the first third and the second third. 

There weren't many negatives to improve on in this lesson, but as did lose hope a bit in the middle of the lesson. I know it's a target I set a few weeks ago, but when you feel hopeless you don't tend to think about targets (specifically ones about not feeling what you currently are). 

Thanks, raish
