Today I looked at the links we had to give for our blog and code. We then went onto github and since a lot of our blogs had broken, we decided to remake our blogs so we could do it in the lesson instead of at a later date when we may have forgotten how. I was a little confused, but after I asked for help, I began to understand how to change our name so my blog would publish. I then wasn't sure how to add a font and colour to my blog, but luckily my teacher was showing some of the class, and then it was a little more clear.

My homework was to re-publish all my posts onto my new account and add a colour to the font on my title.

Thanks, raish-04
