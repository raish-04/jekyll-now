Today in the lesson we began by finishing our discussion on sexting. We then began to look at some techniques for advertising, and then saw some examples of them. It was interesting to see how they psychologically deceived people in a series of different ways, some of which were approaches made from the opposite angles. For example, one of the techniques used was to use celebrities/idols to say they use their product. However, another technique was to use the average, working class person to talk about their product.

At the end, we got homework, we have to look up 3 news articles (current) over a series of 6 days and write a paragraph about why we think that they are propaganda, then post that on our blog.

Thanks, raish-04
