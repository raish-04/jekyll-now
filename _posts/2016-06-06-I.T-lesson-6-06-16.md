Today i worked on the tutorials and did tutorial number 6. I found it very hard as there were some things i wasn't sure what to use and the methods i found took quite a lot of time. But some of it I am quite confident i have done correctly. I accidentally deleted my code at the end but luckily I had saved it onto google docs. I still feel i am not very good at this but i did feel slightly more competent when completing this exercise.

At the end the exercise froze into raw Javascript. Our homework is to do 30 minutes of work from the point we are currently at and also this blog post.

Thank you, raish-04
