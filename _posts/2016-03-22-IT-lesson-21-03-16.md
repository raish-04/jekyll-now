Today we looked at some bad examples of prezi presentations, and we graded them in class. We looked how we could improve our IT in the summer term and wrote that in the back of planner. We also created a learning habit. Mine was to always hand in the best work that I can do. We then looked at a prezi help video and where to access them on the website. Finally, we got our homework; to make a prezi presentation on the history of computers. 

Thanks again, raish-04
