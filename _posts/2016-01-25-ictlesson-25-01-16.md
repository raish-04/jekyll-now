In the lesson today we started by looking at each other's homework and analysing how to edit a PDF. turns out there are loads of different ways from the one i day. We then rated the homework with: unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, and outstanding. Next we looked at the advantages and disadvantages of social media. This took some time as we had to let nearly everyone write something on the board. After we had finished he looked at everything we had put and saw which ones made sense and which ones, well, didn't. Or which ones that cancel themselves out. he then read us the real ones. and gave us homework

thanks again, raish-04
