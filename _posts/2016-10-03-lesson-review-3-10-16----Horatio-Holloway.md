    <td>I usually repeat myself in this blog but fortunately not this time. The best strategy today was to take some more control independently with my work. At the beginning of the lesson I was still a kind of assistant, but as the lesson went on I began to take things into my own hands as Joe (my partner) worked on something that he felt was necessary, then we worked together on the next stage. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>We definitely need to be more slow and careful. So we almost went to far with last weeks target, to stop doing pointless stuff. However, we still did some pointless work in this lesson. So not good. On the topic of not being careful enough, at the beginning of the lesson we copied down some code from an old lesson so Joe could save it on his memory stick. Since it was code quite far back in the book, I believed there were perhaps better things to do with our time, but it would only take 5 minutes max. However, when we finished the code, he quickly exited the window and we weren't sure whether it had saved. As we checked, both our heads fell in our hands. It hadn’t. I think that’s a good example of 2 things we don't want to do again. Do work that may be slightly un-needed, and not saving it once we have finished. Luckily though, Joe re-did it really quickly, so it wasn’t that bad a problem.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my work by definitely just slowing down,  taking everything with a deep breath and thinking carefully about what I’m about to do. Taking 50% of the work helped and may have eased the pressure on Joe too.</td>
