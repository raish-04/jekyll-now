    <td>I learnt by using the same strategies as last lesson, but taking a little more control, as my partner has controlled it more in the past few lessons. I think the most effective strategy was the same one as last lesson as well. Letting us both have our say and then trying both ideas and making a collaborative decision was a good idea. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Unfortunately, we seemed to have repeated ourselves in every manner, including negative. We made the same big mistake as last lesson, but perhaps even more extreme this time. We did ponder with our work and nearing the end of the lesson I spent about 5 minutes copying down our code into my planner. That slowed us down significantly and we need to change that next lesson.</td>
