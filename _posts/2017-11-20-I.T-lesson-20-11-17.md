Today's lesson was cut short by a doctor's appointment I had, so there isn't really that much to blog about, but hey. For the 20 or so minutes of the lesson that i did have, it was relatively productive given that i’d missed the explanation part of the lesson and was a bit lost. I got some help from some helpful people in my class which allowed me to at least got me somewhere. I think that my idea that it’s always okay to ask for assistance was again proven today.

 Sorry it's a bit of a short one.  Cheers, raish.
