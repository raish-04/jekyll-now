My 3 deceptive (current) news articles.

1.

 

 

-

This in an article by the Daily Mail published on the 9th of July, 2016. The main reason I think that this article is deceiving is that it doesn't mention the net migration of nearly all of the Other western European countries, such as france or Italy. It only mentions the countries’ birth rates, so we have no idea whether France’s Net migration is higher than ours. However, it does mention Germany’s, which they admit to be Higher than ours.
