Today's lesson was in most ways very similar to the last. We continued on our work on google spreadsheets and looked at the formula required to use a profit goal to create your selling price, which was, in effect,multiplying the buying price by the profit goal (EG: 20%), Continuously working with the catchphrase: "smarter, not harder". We also looked at the how to transfer the information from different sheets using the allocated codes. There was nothing particularly innovative or different about my “learning strategies” today. I only really zoned out once in today's lesson, but it was during the shorter presentation so when I began to re-focused I was, as I mentioned last blog, lost when concentrating. We also ran overtime because we had a speech about innovative thought and how problem solving helps you have more fulfilling employment.
