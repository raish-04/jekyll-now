Getting more difficult by the lesson

It took me five minutes to log onto the computer at the start of today's lesson. That pretty much summed up how today’s lesson went. At least from how I see it anyway. After I had sorted out the VGA cable and the monitor refusing to take my password by the ancient trick of just turning it off and on again (the vga cable I figured out differently), we dived into the details of the discount code and formula. Today’s lesson was more action and less presentation, which may have been helpful to my confidence in my productivity, and allowed me to get more things done. A lot of people asked me for help today, which is ironic given that I was pretty confused myself. I feel me helping someone else improved my mood and I found that i worked better immediately after at least attempting to help people. I fear that that may have helped me more than I ended up helping them.

Thanks, Raish-04
