Ict lesson 22-02-16

In my Ict lesson on the 22nd of February we handed in our Identity posters (which is a poster about what we want our social media status to be like, and what it is) and people looked at them and commented on them but had to do so anonymously. I felt a bit worried at first that people might say things insulting about it, but it turned out nobody did. As I went through everyone else's maps I had to try and be honest but at the same time not to hurtful. On the whole, I am glad that I wasn't asked those questions directly because sometimes when you are put on the spot, you can’t answer properly. 

Most of the comments were what I expected people to say, such as "too little colour". That said, there was one comment that occurred a few times, which was I had done too much writing. I would always be careful about giving feedback, but even more so when it's in person. I discovered that writing information that was personal to me was quite difficult because i feared people might mock me. I think I’m happy with the amount of social media apps i currently use, but, if something suddenly comes into fashion, and i’m the only one continuing to use a certain app, then I may switch. 

I think that the recent lessons might have reshaped my view of social media a bit, but i was already quite sceptical about that sort of thing.

I think that the lessons I have been having recently will also make me appreciate the wide range of possibilities that social media has to offer a bit more. If I hadn't already learned about internet protection and privacy, It would have taught me that too. On the whole, the experience of writing my social media status opened up things about myself even I didn’t really know, and I chose not to include most of that in my final project.
