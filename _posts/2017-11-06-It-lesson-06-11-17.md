**New topic, same spreadsheet**

The beginning of the half term signalled the beginning of a new topic...sort of. We started looking at cyphers and further coding. However, there were some old familiars as well. Vlookup made a reappearance, as did the if, left and right codes/strings. And that's not forgetting colour coded table. As is tradition at this point, the first part of the lesson was filled with confusion. I didnâ€™t really understand what to do or how to do it. But luckily i began to understand more and more throughout the lesson.

This was mostly due to my decision to ask for help from my friend for help explaining it to me. Although individual intuition and self-help is widely promoted 9 and rightly) I learned that that is always good to ask for a tip in the right direction if you are stuck. I didn't need everything to be explained, but I cannot overstate the importance of giving up pride and asking for a little bit of help to help you go the right way, and then to use your problem solving skills to succeed.
