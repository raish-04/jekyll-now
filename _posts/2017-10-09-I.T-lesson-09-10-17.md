Today's lesson was on of two halves. Having a lesson in period one (which is the case for I.T) can go two ways, depending on my energy levels. I’m either ready for a new day, or exhausted and lethargic, feeling like I belong in bed. Unfortunately, this week was the later. I was so mentally unprepared that I couldn’t string together how to build a functioning costs table, and kept typing and deleting pretty much the same thing. The second half of the lesson was much more productive though. I think that after I answered (or rather attempted to answer) a few questions I felt more awake and ready to work. I think I am in a sense someone who is best at discussion and verbal learning. If this feeling (the one I had at the beginning of the lesson) appears in later lessons I will do my best to get as involved as possible, as I think it helps my focus to be continuously be engaged with whatever the lesson is.

Thanks, Raish-04
