Today's lesson was more productive in most ways. I think that this was mainly because there was no listening: just doing. I think the lack of new things to encounter allowed me to just get some things done and not be overwhelmed by new facts. I managed top colour code a lot of my spreadsheets, edit a lot of dysfunctional formulas and create both a sales and profit sheet, along with editing by blog text (format). Although this may not really sound like much, it at least felt as if I wasn't just stagnating and procrastinating, like that hour was actually worth it. I donâ€™t know if there were any particular learning methods that helped me in this lesson, but I did feel less tired today, which think may have contributed.
