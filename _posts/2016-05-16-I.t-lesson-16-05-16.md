We have now started to work on java script, which proves for a challenging but interesting task. We went onto bbc Microbit and then created our own code on a set of tutorials, with increasing difficulty as they go on. So we spent the majority of the lesson working on them. As the lesson came to a close I was halfway through the 6 tutorials after finishing 3. Although 4 seems to throw you into the deep end.

Coding has never been something I can breeze through without giving it a second thought, in fact it is something I find very hard, but this process is helping me build skills for perhaps more difficult tasks to come. All the same it is a challenging procedure. Hopefully with practice I can better at this sort of thing.

Thanks, raish-04
