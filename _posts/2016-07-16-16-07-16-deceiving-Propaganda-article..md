**Article 3**

This is an article published by the Daily Mail, just before the EU referendum took place,. This article is a definite example of propaganda, as it offers no reasons to stay in the EU. So, it convinces the readers that the decision to Leave the EU was a no-brainer, which it definitely wasn't. It uses strong, one-sided vocabulary such as "blatant", or “bureaucrats” (The use of this word was talking about the leaders in the EU). It also, like many other things supporting the leave campaign, out-and-out lies. It says that if we vote to stay now, we will stay forever. It says that the only choice for someone who believes in Britain is to Vote Leave. But the worst thing is, judging by the referendum results, things like this must have got through to some people.
