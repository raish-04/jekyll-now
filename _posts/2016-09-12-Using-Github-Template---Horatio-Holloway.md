  <tr>
    <td>I learned in a few different ways depending on the situation. If I found the work alright I would listen and write a detailed homework in my planner. Since I didn't find some works too hard, I used my usual homework strategy. This was, take a small rest then begin working. I always did my I.T homework first because it sometimes took longer than the others, depending on the difficulty. If i found it hard, which was what was most common, I just used the same routine but would sometimes call a friend or parent to talk to them about it. In the case of talking to a friend, I would ask how they managed and if they had a tip. If i found it really challenging, I tended to panic so I normally took a break and did the other homeworks first, then came back to I.T later.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think panicking limited my learning a lot. Sometimes worrying about how good the work was going to be harmed the overall quality of the work. It also took out a lot of energy and I was very tired while doing my work in lessons, or at home. So my main target for this year is to worry less and perhaps concentrate a little more. I think I should also try to ask for help more in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I say, what I will try to change is my panic and attention span. Thatâ€™s the first way I will improve my learning. I will also try to improve my learning by 2. Asking more questions and contributing more to the class discussions. 3. Being more time efficient with the amount of time we have in class to do the work we have been set. For my learning, those three things will help quite a bit if I follow them for the rest of the year.</td>
