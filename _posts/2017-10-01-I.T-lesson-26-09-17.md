Spreadsheets had been relatively easy until this point. Although it is by no means impossible, the code and formula has become increasingly complicated. On the subject of fading out in lesson, I feel like I payed attention consistently throughout the lesson. Whether that's to do with self-improvement or just the lessons more challenging nature is up for debate, but I definitely felt improvement. The code based on the "left" function, despite its explanation in lessons, still left me relatively baffled. I looked up the meaning of the left function among other things, but the internet didnâ€™t make it any clearer. I thought I knew but when i actually had to do the thing, I found I was lost. I tried to layout the necessary tables, etc, given that I knew how to do that. Hopefully i will understand more next lesson.

Thanks, raish-04
