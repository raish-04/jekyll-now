I wasn't in the lesson today for Drama rehearsals so there’s not really all that much to report on. I managed to get some work done at home, which was good. I think this may have been due to one of the following reasons…

1. I felt less lethargic and tired because I had a small break after school. 

2. Wasn't stressed about timings, etc…

3. I couldn't get help, which meant I had to think only for myself.

4. Most likely, these exercises were just a bit easier (for me anyway) than the others.

I could have improved on focus maybe, but more problems may have arisen of the exercises had been as they were in recent wweeks.

Cheers. raish-04
