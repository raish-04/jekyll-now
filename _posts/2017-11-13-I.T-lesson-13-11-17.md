Today's lesson wasn't exactly super productive, but it wasnâ€™t counterproductive either. The lesson  mostly consisted of listening to the teacher explain the basics of spreadsheet code, which was useful given I was a little confused about that topic up to that point. We then went onto new code, which I understood a bit more than normal. However, when the topic moved away from logic and problem solving and onto Internet science, I began to understand less and less. But as I asked for help, things started to become clearer and I left today's lesson with a better sense of confidence on the topic than I would have expected.
