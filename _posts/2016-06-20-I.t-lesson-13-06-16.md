Today I began to create my own game. It was a difficult task as I wasn't sure that the plan I had set out was plausible. However, it turned out it was, but it would have to take some independent and innovative thinking. I felt quite unsure that I was capable, but I managed to begin and also try to help out my friend who was also struggling. I had to try and use some code that I hadn’t practised much if at all in the tutorials. For example, I was not sure how I would set up the player to be able to jump over the rock (the game I was creating was called 'mountain climber’ where you have to jump over a rock 20 times but each time the amount of time you have to run across flat ground decreases). So I decided I would create a ‘player’ variable. 

By the end of the lesson I hadn't got much code down that i was almost certain worked, and then I tried to copy and paste it and it deleted.

Thank you, raish-04.
