    <td>Same as usual really, but to more of an extreme/developed past learning strategies. I began the lesson a few levels behind my working partner so had to work as quickly as I could to catch up to him (so we could work together). Luckily I got the hang of Basic Boolean Code quicker than I expected, so this was achievable Once I had, we almost immediately got stuck on a complicated exercise. After about 10 minutes of attempts we went onto the Codecademy help Page. It took some searching, but we eventually found an example someone had set up for a different problem and saw that we had to add brackets. I did this and, it worked, and my partner had a code error but he corrected it quickly. After that mild success, I got through the exercises quote quickly for the duration of the lesson. I didn't get many done though, as I spent time understanding how things worked. Also, the exercisers got increasingly harder.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I went to slowly at times but I realise that it is more useful to take things with some hesitation in order to learn from whatever you are doing. I feel overall this was quite a productive lesson. I only go through one percent of the overall Python training apparently so perhaps I will speed up when not absorbing and understanding information in future.</td>

    <td>Tery to speed up when not concentrating and to sometimes admit defeat (as in; "I don’t understand and have tried to use my own intuition but with little success, so I need help").
