Codecademy is getting the better of me. Whether it is badly made or whether I am being thick is up for debate, but I'm willing to bet it’s the latter. Coding, for good reason, is very pedantic. The reason I mention this is that I spent 5 to 10 minutes trying to see what I’d done wrong (adding 'print’, changing word order, etc…) only to find that I got it right the first time apart from the wrong inverted commas on one word (I’s used apostrophes instead (one dash, not two)). That was the story of today’s lesson. That and struggling creating and setting variables in the right line. By the later part of the lesson I found myself overjoyed at the littlest of achievements and advancements (like creating a variable in the right line). Codecademy instructions treat you like an I.T master, which I find difficult to follow, given that I’m not. Eg: word that holds the .lower()-case conversion of original. However, in the last quarter of the lesson, I began to regain ‘form’. I managed to get through three exercises pretty quickly. The way I did this is did the code required to run the original question, then manipulate my answer on the (what I did wrong). Eg: I put in ‘yay’ and it said "yayay" instead of “yayyay”. So next time I answered ‘yayy’. That added a hint of success to an average lesson.
