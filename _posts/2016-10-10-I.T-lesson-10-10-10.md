    <td>I think I'm starting to repeat myself in this blog and that might be a recurring pattern. The best strategies stay the same. Giving both of ourselves (me and Joe) a time to speak and put our ideas into place. The strategy to decipher which work was crucial and to look through and decide whether we should skip or do it worked well. We did end up doing almost everything to be safe, but it still saved us about 5 minutes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think my partner took too much control in this lesson (at least for the fast half). Luckily he realised this when I did. So he gave the work to me and we agreed I should do the main job for a bit, which helped. Another thing that hindered me was moving around too much. Doesn't sound serious, but I do think I wasted a few minutes spinning on my chair and fidgeting.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Keep still as well as I can. Take more control so I do about 50% of the work every lesson.</td>
