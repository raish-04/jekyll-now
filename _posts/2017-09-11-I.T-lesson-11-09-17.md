**Back again**

The beginning of year nine brought an end to the work on Codecademy and a begging to looking a google sheets and the useful technology involved in that. Google sheets definitely seems like a program I am potentially more likely to use on a regular basis than some other softwares we have covered in recent years. Having used software very similar to this in year 6, I felt reasonably comfortable when going into this lesson once in the knowledge that this was the topic we were covering. After testing the waters of google sheets I thought that I had forgotten it all but after the teacher gave the first tutorial it, to an extent, came flooding back to me. I feel like I  did quite a lot in this first lesson, given that I have learned/re-learned:

-The basic format of sheets

-How to use functions, what they do and when to use them

-How to create a box and list

-How to select pieces of data and create a function from said pieces of data

I did however notice that during some of the tutorials I occasionally lost concentration for about 20 seconds, and once I was back in focus I was already lost and slightly confused about what people were saying. I will try to make sure I am completely attentive next lesson.
