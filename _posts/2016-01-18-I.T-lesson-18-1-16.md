We started by watching 3 ads and summarising which parts of them were realistic, and which parts were fantastical, and whether it was a good ad overall. One of the ads was an ad for a reality tv show which I thought was particularly deceptive because it was about who could lose the most weight, but there was 25 grand up for grabsâ€¦ why? The show's reward was losing a lot of weight and getting a better life expectancy so why did they throw in money in a show that had nothing to do with that. We then did an exercise where our teacher made statements and we had to move across the room with one side being strongly agree and the other being strongly disagree, and all the other room was everything in between. We then had to come back at break time to summarise the lesson and get homework.

Thanks again, Raish-04
