    <td>I Learnt that you always need to compromise with time, or it will go against you. With the knowledge I mentioned last week about writing our own program with the fuze code, I wanted to understand what we did. So my partner (who's back now) and I came up with a similar strategy to help us with that target. One of us wrote the code as the other tried to figure out what it meant and why it did what it did. If I (the latter) couldn’t, then I would research it. This worked, except it took a while, and we got through things slowly. This would have been O.K, apart from the fact that I had just realised we were behind most of the class.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We spent too long on things. I’m now creating a term/phrase that I will mention whenever this situation occurs. It’s called 'target over-fulfillment’. This means that I have succeeded so much in my target that it causes another problem, EG: Take things slow leads to not going fast enough. I definitely over fulfilled my target today. We worked so slowly that most of the solid work was done in the last 5 minutes, when we rushed. We spent too long discussing and analysing I think, although spending some time on that is good, a 50\50 would work.</td>
