    <td>My creativity for learning strategies is wearing thin at this point. However, that does not mean that I don't already have techniques I have previously used that I am content with. For example. The majority of the lesson consisted of me and the people sitting near me helping each other with the code if we were ever stuck. The way that this week was unique though        was that we never directly gave each other the answer. We instead gave each other tips (different from the hints that the website itself it provide) that allowed the person who was being helped to figure things out (partly) out for themselves, which obviously helps more in the long run.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Until about 20 minutes to go I was reading instructions kind of blindly and was getting through the exercises without really understanding them. I figured this put when I came to an exercise that said something similar "when you can predict what this code will print then press save and continue". This sudden change showed me that I didn’t really understand was I was doing and when I had to show (although I could have just pressed continue) that I understood 'strings’ I was almost clueless to WHY things worked and not just HOW things worked. I discussed this with the people next to me and we agreed to maybe read more slowly and take each exercise in before going to the next one.</td>
