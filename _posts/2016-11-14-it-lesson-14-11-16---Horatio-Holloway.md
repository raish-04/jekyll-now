    <td>Me and Joe FINALLY did the same amount of work, so the "method" we used seemed to be working. Do roughly five minutes as the other person either reads the code, or discusses it, then switch over (unless there is some situational exception). I don't think I learnt that much for the first 50 minutes of the lesson, but much more in the last 15 (the class was kept in by accident for a bit). The majority was just copying down code, but after I finished the code, we wondered what all the masses of numbers from 1-500 meant. Since the only result of the code was three symbols coming one after the other (I…(heart)...(space invader symbol), we thought about changing the numbers. We started changing the numbers by one or two, and it changed the position of a at the top of the screen pixel. But before we could try much more the lesson ended.</td>

    <td>It was a pretty successful lesson really. The only thing I can think of improving on is listening 100% of the time. I sometimes drifted off when I wasn’t doing too much.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by Keeping my concentration on at all times. Perhaps try to keep still a bit more, just to make sure I frustrate anyone around me.</td>
