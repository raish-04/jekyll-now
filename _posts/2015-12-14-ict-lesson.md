This is what we did in our i.t lesson 14/12/15

We started our lesson by looking over why some of us couldn't publish the homework. Some of the reasons were:

.we had ticked the wrong box on gabriel

.we put spaces in the title and filename

.we had put our instagram name on our account description

.we hadn't put spaces in front of our account description

Then we changed the background of our site/blog to a colour of our choice by going onto a site were we copied the colour code into a blog details. We still had to leave spaces in front of the hash then did the same for the title and text. Then we checked whether that had successfully published by going onto settings. Then we had to change our avatars if we hadn't already. Finally we were given homework to tweak around with the font and write this.
