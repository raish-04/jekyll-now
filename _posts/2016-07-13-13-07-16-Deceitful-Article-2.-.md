**Article 2**

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/nufeR448ChDt1EiQO0ShBw_img_0.png)                                                                                                                                                            

This article is from the Daily Telegraph. The main reason I think that this is deceitful is because at the beginning of the article it talks about David Cameron's experience after the Loss in the EU referendum. But, they have no idea what he thought after finding out the result or even what he did for the next few hours. As a newspaper that is typically very right-wing, it was probably pro-brexit. And because of this, it talks about him in a bias (anti-him) manor. Furthermore, they sometimes put him down saying " He lacks the talent of an actor or a PR guru to make the audience love him. Uncomfortable with emotion, he would only very reluctantly talk about himself.
