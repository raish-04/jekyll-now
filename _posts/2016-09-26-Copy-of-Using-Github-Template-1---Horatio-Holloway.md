    <td>Well, in my partnership, I did more of the work this week as he controlled more of it last week. My strategy and his was to let each of us have our say, try both, then see which worked better. This did work in the end as our finishing product for the lesson was a success. We did panic at the beginning but it didn't last.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think the only with this lesson learning was the indecisiveness which resulted in us being quite slow with our work. In some decisions about things like colour of text and speed of which it appeared, we kept on going back and forth and took too long to make a choice.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What I am going to change is what i did wrong. Iâ€™ll try to make quicker decisions and not look back at them for the rest of the lesson worrying if I did it wrong. It think being anxious and taking too long can hinder my productivity.</td>
