In the lesson today we had to move into a different room. We then looked at what we were scared of on social media. It allowed me to learn about some dangers on social media that i didn't know about before like catfishing. It was also a good way to see all of the potential uses of social media. It felt quite scary that there were so many dangers on social media and how many people, for example, can hack into your account.

For homework, we had to look up news stories on sexting and revenge pornography.

Thanks, raish-04
