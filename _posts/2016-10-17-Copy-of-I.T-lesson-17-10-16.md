There is not much new to say anymore, as the things I did well in this lesson are mostly the same things that I have done well in lessons before, now I'm into week 6. The only new thing that I did well in this lesson was taking more control of the work, one of my targets. However, I feel I might have doing over 50% of the work this week, so it has flipsided.</td>

Luckily Joe remembered his memory stick, so doing less important, and especially repeated work, wasn’t a problem. What was a problem however, WAS DELETING CODE WE HAD ALREADY WRITTEN!!!. As a pair we always seem to find a way of repeating work we have already done, and writing out code for a second time takes a long time. I didn’t keep still again, though more still than last week, so on the right track (yaaaay).</td>
