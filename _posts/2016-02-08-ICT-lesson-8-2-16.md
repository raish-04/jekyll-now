Today we looked at our social media homework and whether anyone in our family might be addicted to social media. We then went on to different types of addiction like drugs and alcohol. We looked at what our parents do on their social media, like make it about their family or their work or something else. After that we focused on the different types of people we are when we are in different situations. Finally we looked at our social media status and how that can be different from who we are in real life. We then got homework to make a map on our relationship status.

Thanks, raish-04
